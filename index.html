        <p class="text-center text-white">Oxford Skill & Coaching Institute (OSCI) lies on the famed NTR road—linking
          the world-famed winter tourist resort of Gulmarg to the rest of the country. The Institute is located ideally,
          near Govt Higher Secondary School, Chandilora—making it convenient and easily accessible for the learners,
          who come (to the Institute) in droves from GHSS, Govt. Degree College ( Chandilora) and other educational
          Institutes in the adjoining parts.
          As the northern part of Kashmir—Chandilora—has emerged as the den of coaching Centers at unregulated pace, I
          took upon this huge obligation of chipping in with my contribution—an effort which led to the establishment of
          OCI in 2017. The sole motto and mantra of starting OCI was to transform the way education is imparted in all
          the coaching Centers – in the vicinity and the adjoining hubs.
          Being a strong votary of quality education, I am heaving a huge sigh of relief, basking in the glory of this
          undisputed fact that my Institute has lived upto its billing by disseminating affordable and quality
          education, despite being in the naïve stage of operations.
          Catering to the needs of students’ from diverse backgrounds, OCI has carved a unique niche among the galore of
          coaching Institutes, functioning here. The speedy success of the Institute has become worth-emulating for its
          counterparts (in the area) as I have set the ball of quality education rolling right from the day of inception
          of my societal obligation.
          Many years now into my operation at the OCI, I am swelling with pride that the perennial coaching imparted in
          our Institute has ushered in a new era of quality education and produced overwhelming outcome.
          It is pertinent to mention here that students’ appearing in Board exams for class 8th, 10th, 11th and 12th (in
          Arts and Science stream) have passed their exams with flying colours, attesting my efforts of turning a new
          leaf in their learning and understanding skills.
          The overall satisfaction exuded and expressed by the learners’ ( enrolled at OCI) is endorsement of my efforts
          to promote best educational and technological know-how, cutting across the diversity of prerequisites in
          today’s competitive and cut-throat educational ambience.
          At the conclusion, I declare with unwavering commitment that OCI will work for the betterment of community as
          a whole in Tangmarg, and other adjoining parts by complementing the school education of the wards with quality
          result-oriented and effective coaching. </p>

    <div class="col-12 bg-dark text-center text-white">
        <p>In an era of educational boom, It is a huge privilege and an overwhelming
            overture (on my part) to delve deep into the realms of learning, endeavoring hard to streamline
            dissemination and acquisition of quality education among the budding students’ in our locality.
            With the proliferation of diversity in education penetrating at promising levels, It is a huge onus to
            shoulder the responsibility of providing quality academic and skill based education among the learners’
            in our locality. Subsequently, we are driven by the desire of deriving the best out of learners’ cashing
            in on the creative aspect of learning.
            The mantra of our learning Centre hinges on adorning learners’ with the requisite learning skills as
            well as quenching their thirst of taking on the world with knowledge and technological know-how. This
            acts as the guiding force for my team as we are wedded to the concept of preserving quality in the din
            of quantity galore.
            Education has diversified with the onset of digital revolution across the world. The transition from
            bookish to skill based learning offers me a window of opportunity to contribute in transfiguration of my
            students’ into potent weapons of developmental resources.
            There is no denying that the mushroom growth of coaching Centers has dented the quality of education,
            taking it for a serious ride, which poses a serious threat to the comprehension power of learners.
            Against this backdrop, I have started a humble initiative through my learning Centre where the mantra of
            teaching is to make the learners’ ooze with confidence and exude educational and technical oomph to
            carve a unique niche for themselves in respective fields.
            Apart from blessing the students with academic knowledge, our learning Centre also contributes in honing
            the skills of local girls’ by making them conversant with various skill based courses promoted by the
            Government of India.
            Sponsored by the Union government of minorities, the learners’ are also paid monthly stipends
            considering their background in consideration. The aim is to reach out to the weaker sections of
            society, enlist the potential learners’ for provision of various skill based courses across various
            sector
