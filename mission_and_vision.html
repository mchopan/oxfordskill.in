        <p>In an era of educational boom, It is a huge privilege and an overwhelming
            overture (on my part) to delve deep into the realms of learning, endeavoring hard to streamline
            dissemination and acquisition of quality education among the budding students’ in our locality.
            With the proliferation of diversity in education penetrating at promising levels, It is a huge onus to
            shoulder the responsibility of providing quality academic and skill based education among the learners’
            in our locality. Subsequently, we are driven by the desire of deriving the best out of learners’ cashing
            in on the creative aspect of learning.
            The mantra of our learning Centre hinges on adorning learners’ with the requisite learning skills as
            well as quenching their thirst of taking on the world with knowledge and technological know-how. This
            acts as the guiding force for my team as we are wedded to the concept of preserving quality in the din
            of quantity galore.
            Education has diversified with the onset of digital revolution across the world. The transition from
            bookish to skill based learning offers me a window of opportunity to contribute in transfiguration of my
            students’ into potent weapons of developmental resources.
            There is no denying that the mushroom growth of coaching Centers has dented the quality of education,
            taking it for a serious ride, which poses a serious threat to the comprehension power of learners.
            Against this backdrop, I have started a humble initiative through my learning Centre where the mantra of
            teaching is to make the learners’ ooze with confidence and exude educational and technical oomph to
            carve a unique niche for themselves in respective fields.
            Apart from blessing the students with academic knowledge, our learning Centre also contributes in honing
            the skills of local girls’ by making them conversant with various skill based courses promoted by the
            Government of India.
            Sponsored by the Union government of minorities, the learners’ are also paid monthly stipends
            considering their background in consideration. The aim is to reach out to the weaker sections of
            society, enlist the potential learners’ for provision of various skill based courses across various
            sector
